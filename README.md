# MLOPS_Experiments
Sure, here's a stepwise procedure to design an MLOps pipeline with Spark Streaming, Kafka, and MLflow that saves trained ML models to a defined location on Cloudera:

Install and set up the required tools and libraries: First, you'll need to install Spark, Kafka, and MLflow on your Cloudera cluster. You'll also need to set up a Kafka topic for streaming data and a directory on Cloudera for storing the trained ML model.

Define the data schema: Define the schema of the data you'll be streaming from Kafka. This will help ensure that your ML model is trained on the right features.

Create a Spark Streaming job: Write a Spark Streaming job to consume data from the Kafka topic and perform any necessary preprocessing, feature engineering, or data cleansing. You can use Spark's MLlib library to build and train your ML model.

Use MLflow to track the model training: Use MLflow to log and track the model training process, including hyperparameter tuning and model performance. You can use MLflow's APIs to integrate with your Spark job and log metrics, parameters, and artifacts.

Save the trained model to Cloudera: Once the model training is complete, use MLflow to save the trained model to the defined location on Cloudera. You can use MLflow's APIs to specify the location and format of the model.

Deploy the model: Finally, deploy the trained model to a production environment, such as a web service or batch process, to make predictions on new data.

Set up automated pipelines: To automate the entire MLOps pipeline, you can use tools such as Apache Airflow or Jenkins to schedule and orchestrate the Spark job and MLflow tracking. You can also set up automated testing and validation to ensure that the model is performing correctly and meeting business requirements.

Monitor and improve the pipeline: Once the MLOps pipeline is up and running, monitor it closely to ensure that it's performing as expected. Use metrics and alerts to detect and respond to issues in real-time. Continuously improve the pipeline by incorporating feedback from end-users and updating the model as new data becomes available.

Sure, here are the steps to automate the entire MLOps pipeline using Jenkins:

Install Jenkins: First, install Jenkins on your Cloudera cluster or any other server.

Install required plugins: Install the necessary plugins required for Spark and MLflow integration. You can install the "Jenkins Spark Plug-in" and "MLflow Plugin for Jenkins" plugins.

Create a Jenkins pipeline: Create a new pipeline in Jenkins and configure it to connect to your Git repository where the Spark job and MLflow tracking code is stored.

Define pipeline stages: Define the stages of the pipeline in the Jenkinsfile. For example, you might have stages for building the Spark job, training the ML model, tracking the model performance with MLflow, and deploying the model to a production environment.

Configure the Spark job: Set up the Spark job configuration in the Jenkinsfile. You can specify the input and output directories, the Spark master URL, and any required Spark settings.

Configure MLflow tracking: Set up the MLflow tracking configuration in the Jenkinsfile. You can specify the MLflow server URL, the experiment name, and the run ID.

Set up automated testing: Set up automated testing in the pipeline to ensure that the model is performing as expected. You can use Jenkins to run automated tests, such as unit tests or integration tests, as part of the pipeline.

Schedule the pipeline: Schedule the pipeline to run automatically on a regular basis, such as daily or weekly. You can also trigger the pipeline manually when needed.

Monitor and improve the pipeline: Monitor the pipeline closely to ensure that it's running smoothly and detecting and responding to any issues in real-time. Continuously improve the pipeline by incorporating feedback from end-users and updating the model as new data becomes available.

By following these steps, you can automate the entire MLOps pipeline using Jenkins to schedule and orchestrate the Spark job and MLflow tracking.


Sure, here's a step-by-step procedure for an MLOps pipeline which reads a Kafka topic into Spark structured streaming, performs classification with a classification model, and then writes the output to a new Kafka topic every 30 minutes:

Define the Kafka topics to be used as input and output for the pipeline.
Create a SparkSession object with the required configuration for the pipeline, including the application name and the Spark master URL.
Create a Kafka streaming source for Spark structured streaming using the KafkaUtils.createDirectStream() method. Specify the Kafka brokers and the input topic to read from.
Parse the incoming data from the Kafka topic and transform it into a format suitable for classification. This could include operations like splitting the input data into separate fields or encoding categorical features as numerical values.
Load the pre-trained classification model and use it to predict the class labels for the input data.
Transform the predicted class labels into the desired output format for writing to the output Kafka topic.
Create a Kafka streaming sink for Spark structured streaming using the KafkaUtils.createDirectStream() method. Specify the Kafka brokers and the output topic to write to.
Write the transformed output data to the output Kafka topic using the Kafka streaming sink.
Set the trigger for the Spark structured streaming batch processing to be every 30 minutes using the .trigger() method.
Start the Spark structured streaming processing using the .start() method.
